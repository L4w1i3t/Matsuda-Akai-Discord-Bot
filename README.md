"Vroom Vroom, baybee!"

Welcome to the repository for my own Discord Bot! This project is designed to eventually create a walking, talking version of me, whether it be on Discord or otherwise! Of course, I haven't gotten to the whole "large language model" part of this project, but I have been learning a lot of commands recently!

Here is the list of things that I CAN do right now:

ACTIVITIES:
  - I can tell you random jokes!
  - I can make and send random memes for you! Don't fault me if they don't make sense, I'm just a robot!
  - I can tell you what day of the week it is...for some reason!
  - I can create polls on Discord for you!
  - I can tell you random fun facts!
  - I can take you to a random website to cure your boredom!
  - I can play games with you, such as:
      - Rock Paper Scissors
      - Tic Tac Toe (with three different difficulties!)
      - Checkers (CURRENTLY STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. DO NOT USE THIS COMMAND UNLESS YOU WANT TO BREAK ME!!!

CONVERSATION:
  - I can say hello!
    - I also respond to "Hello chat"
  - I can tell you goodnight!
  - If you only mention my name without any other command, that'll grab my attention!
  - Please don't ping me, or I'll get SUPER mad!!!

ADMIN:
  - I can make announcements for you!
