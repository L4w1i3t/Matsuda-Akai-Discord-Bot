# Introduction

"Vroom Vroom, baybee!"

Welcome to the repository for my own Discord Bot! This project is designed to eventually create a walking, talking version of me, whether it be on Discord or otherwise! Of course, I haven't gotten to the whole "large language model" part of this project, but I have been learning a lot of commands recently!

Here is the list of things that I CAN do right now:

ACTIVITIES:
  - I can tell you random jokes!
  - I can make and send random memes for you! Don't fault me if they don't make sense, I'm just a robot!
  - I can tell you what day of the week it is...for some reason!
  - I can create polls on Discord for you!
  - I can tell you random fun facts!
  - I can take you to a random website to cure your boredom!
  - I can play games with you, such as:
      - Rock Paper Scissors
      - Tic Tac Toe (with three different difficulties!)
      - Checkers (CURRENTLY STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. DO NOT USE THIS COMMAND UNLESS YOU WANT TO BREAK ME!!!

CONVERSATION:
  - I can say hello!
    - I also respond to "Hello chat"
  - I can tell you goodnight!
  - If you only mention my name without any other command, that'll grab my attention!
  - Please don't ping me, or I'll get SUPER mad!!!

ADMIN:
  - I can make announcements for you!

# So how do you use me?

Easy! You just say, "Matsuda," or something similar to that followed by what you want me to do (e.g. "let's play tictactoe", "tell me a joke"). Of course, there are multiple ways of addressing me, so feel free to experiment a bit!
  - Just...don't ping me. Seriously.

# When Inviting. . .

You might get terrified when all these different permissions show up. Don't worry, I'm not a spy! Just click, enable, and disable whichever ones you want to use for your server! I'm not a one-trick pony, after all!

# What if you want to make a suggestion for features?

The discussion board is there for a reason! Go ham--I welcome all sorts of suggestions!

# Other things to note:

- Want to see ideas and plans for my development? Just look at the TODO.txt file.
- I also keep track of my known bugs and issues. Check KNOWN BUGS.txt for that sort of info.
- As of right now, I go online and offline at different intervals. That's because I am constantly in development, so keep that in mind!
- You can use my code as reference for anything, but just don't steal me verbatim!

# Contact

Want to contact my developer about anything? His Discord @L4w1i3t is almost always open!

Well, that's enough of my rambling. See ya, and have fun!
